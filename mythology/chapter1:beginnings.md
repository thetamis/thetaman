It all began on a dark and stormy night in a narrow alleyway on **Thetamisland**. Rain fell in sharp, slanted sheets, striking the concrete with a relentless hiss. Thunder growled overhead like something ancient and watchful, while the wind funneled through the alley, carrying scraps of paper, broken leaves, and whispers of a city that never truly slept.

In the center of the alley, beneath a flickering streetlamp, a small **Thetegg** lay abandoned.

The **Thetegg** shook violently as it rolled across the wet concrete, jolted forward by each crack of thunder. Its shell was smooth but etched with faint, glowing symbols that pulsed in rhythm with the storm. With every pulse, the light grew brighter, as if the **Thetegg** itself were drawing power from the chaos of the night.

Suddenly, a sharp crack split the air.

The **Thetegg** lurched to a halt.

For a moment, all was still—until a thin fracture appeared along its surface. The crack glowed white-hot, spreading like lightning across the shell. Another thunderclap echoed, and the **Thetegg** burst open in a flash of light.

From within emerged something small, trembling, and alive.

A newborn **Thetaman** lay on the rain-soaked ground, curled instinctively, as though the storm itself were too loud for such a new existence. His skin shimmered faintly, still carrying the residual glow of the **Thetegg**, and his eyes—closed tightly—flickered beneath their lids, as if already dreaming.

The storm began to weaken.

Rain softened. Thunder retreated into distant murmurs. It was as though the night had accomplished what it came to do.

The **Thetaman** stirred.

His fingers twitched first, then his arms, and finally his eyes opened. They reflected the dim streetlight, bright with curiosity rather than fear. Though he had just been born, there was a strange awareness in his gaze, an understanding that he was not merely a child of flesh and bone, but something more.

The alley felt different now.

The shadows leaned inward, the air thick with possibility. Somewhere deep beneath **Thetamisland**, ancient forces shifted, sensing that a new **Thetaman** had arrived. For centuries, **Thetamis** had appeared rarely, born only when the balance of the world demanded it.

And tonight, the balance had tipped.

The newborn **Thetaman** attempted to stand, his legs unsteady but determined. He fell once, then again, but on the third attempt, he remained upright. Rainwater streamed down his face, yet he did not cry. Instead, he laughed—a quiet, uncertain sound that echoed softly against the alley walls.

As he took his first step forward, the glowing fragments of the shattered **Thetegg** dissolved into mist and vanished, leaving no trace that they had ever existed. The **Thetaman** was alone now, but not lost.

Above him, the clouds began to part.

A single beam of moonlight shone down into the alley, illuminating the small figure standing at the center of it all. Though no one was there to witness the moment, history had been set in motion.

This was not just the birth of a being.

This was the beginning of **Thetaman**.

And though the city of **Thetamisland** carried on, unaware of what had just occurred, the world would soon feel the presence of this new **Thetaman**—one who would grow, learn, and one day stand among the legends of the **Thetamis**.

But for now, he took another careful step forward, disappearing into the night, carrying the storm within him.
